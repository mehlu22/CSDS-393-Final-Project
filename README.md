# CSDS-393-Final-Project (SARA)
A group final project for Software Engineering(CSDS 393).
Our application is named SARA (Smart Allocator of Residence and Ambition). The application includes a city search, a city-based job search, as well as a city-based housing search. The city search includes 20 cities, including but not limited to Austin, Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. To determine a user's city, they will input their preferences for specific variables, such as population, temperature, and precipitation. From this, the algorithm will return three cities for the user, which will be the cities that match the user's preferences the best. From this, the user must select one city, which will be used to match the user to jobs and housing in that city.
